# Can you hear me now?

Sweet, I can still do this.  Or at least, by the time this is published I'll still be able to do this.

Woohoo!

Been neglecting this pretty much since it's inception.  Would be nice to actually have something worth looking at come next years Geek Mental Health Week.

On a more technical pain in the arse kind of note, you ever notice that these things never seem to be ready to just go?  To even write this I had to replace rbenv and its associated ruby versions/ gems, update my entire project (fingers crossed it still deploys) and reconfigure access to GitHub because its been so long since I've done this that I have a new machine.  Not to mention that this thing is a Windows device and I'm essentially rolling the bones as to whether this works or not.

Last time I considered doing something developer like on this machine I spent the better part of a Saturday smashing Windows/Linux/Vagrant/NFS/Ansible together before getting very pissed off and leaving it.  Hopefully this will go smoother: although it would be nice to have a proper stack running to support this.

You know.  Because developer.

Hmmm... I might need my eyes tested as well.  The font on the home page is either too small or the contrast ratios not cutting it.  Maybe I'll bump it up with this post

This will do for now though, C out.
