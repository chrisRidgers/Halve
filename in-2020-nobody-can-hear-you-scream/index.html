Between celebrity deaths, referendums, political elections, wildfires, security breaches, terror attacks, global warming (to name a few off the top of my head) I’m pretty certain we’ve not had a month let alone a year where we’ve got to the end and thought anything positive about it.</p> <p>Indeed, new years resolutions for the last half a decade could pretty much be summed up as, ‘Do better. Be less shit.’ There will be year where I can look back and say we’ve pulled it off, but it is not this year.</p> <p><img src="/images/not-this-day.gif" alt="Aragorn proclaiming that Today is not that day! while epically riding a steed" /></p> <p>2020 came in as badly as 2019 went out: Christmas Eve saw a family member going into hospital for medical reasons unknown and sadly never came out again. It’s been rough on my partner and her Dad. The last few years have been an emotional roller coaster of hospital trips, and the last few involved intensive care units and more questions then answers. But to top it all off, this was immediately followed by the country imploding as it dealt with a pandemic. We’ve not physically visited her Dad in months due to lock down, grieving is still ongoing.</p> <p>We’ve missed some other stuff as well, like the birth of my nephew (the idea of being pregnant in lock down is the absolute worst) but so far we’re considering ourselves lucky to have been so lightly touched by this health crisis.</p> <p>And it is a health crisis. There’s no way the numbers are accurate.</p> <p>Work is… a thing. I have a habit of ignoring stressful stuff as much as possible and I’m putting as little thoght as possible into this. Glad I have some savings but right now I wish it was more.</p> <p>The only positive currently is I’ve been hammering my fitness while self isolating. I miss the Welsh hills, but I’ve dropped a bunch of fat even if my weights remained at a chonky 16St (101kg -ish for those of you who didn’t Brexit themselves into the dark ages). It has been super cool adapting my diet to veganism and following a plan to suit my exercise regime. The Centr app I’ve bought into is amazing. It provides meal plans, helps collate shopping lists, provides workouts and other well being content into a daily planner - something incredibly useful to someone as scatty as me, especially given the lack of routine I would have fallen into w/o going to work.</p> <p><img src="/images/workouts-are-hard.gif" alt="Woman crawling across floor, text reads It's like I did that push up last year for nothing" /></p> <br> <nav class="pagination"> <a href="https://chrisridgers.github.io/can-you-hear-me-now/" class="pagination_pager" title="/var/log/can_you_hear_me_now ">previous</a> <a href="#" class="pagination_pager disabled">next</a> </nav> </div> </div> <!-- JS --> <script src="https://chrisridgers.github.io/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <div class="overlay"> <ul class="projects-menu"> <li style="background:url(http://taylantatli.me/Halve/images/halve-home-image.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Halve" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Halve Jekyll Theme <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/754514/14509720/61c61058-01d6-11e6-93ab-0918515ecd56.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Moon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Moon Jekyll Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Ramme/master/assets/img/screenshot-post.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Ramme" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Ramme Jekyll Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Daisy-Pelican-Theme/master/Preview-1.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Daisy-Pelican-Theme/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Daisy Pelican Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Block-Icon-Theme/master/Preview.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Block-Icon-Theme" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Block Icon Theme <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/StartPage/master/preview.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/StartPage/" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Start Page <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </body> </html>
