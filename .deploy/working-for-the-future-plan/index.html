Besides the spectacular views, it offered a great opportunity to reflect on where I am right now in life and where I would like to progress to in future.</p> <p>I deliberately avoided taking my laptop with me. I already knew that some none screen time was required for my mental health, but also I was expecting the internet in Norway to be crap. It was not. I had 4G pretty much none stop all the way around the coast, even in Kirkenes right up in Finmark near the Russian border.</p> <p>While I was itching to get back at a keyboard before we returned, the last few days without really helped me mull through a few self truths and decide on a plan for my return.</p> <p>So before looking forward, let us look back.</p> <h2 id="what-kind-of-person-am-i">What kind of person am I?</h2> <p>I am not what you would call a ‘social person’. I remember sitting in the car at 16 years old talking with Mum about the future and saying, “I don’t know what I want to do. But I do know I don’t want it to be either in a service industry, or in sales.” This is obviously unrealistic: now I cannot think of any roles that do not fit into one or both of those categories. But it does say a lot about what I ‘wanted’ from life.</p> <p>I think this is partly why I gravitated towards computers as a child. Even from a young age there are stories of me turning up in preschool and blanking the other kids there while staring at a computer screen for the day. Later on when presented with the reality of growing up and getting a ‘profession’ or even just a job, I think I viewed computers as an alternative to people.</p> <p>Unfortunately for me it turns out that the vast majority of computer work is driven by social interaction. We work in teams. Our skills complement each other. We learn from each other. Our ability to pull requirements from our clients is key. Features themselves can be heavily predicated on the social interactions of users. This is before even considering our own personal brand — how we market ourselves and source work throughout our career. If there is a profession out there for wannabe hermits: Development is not it.</p> <p>I am also pretty convinced that there is a certain social pressure to be socially accessible to other human beings which has until now been a major factor in me being unwilling to recognise this about myself. You can hardly walk into an interview and when asked, “How are you working within a team?” respond with, “Well ideally everyone would fuck off and leave me alone, but I get on alright.”</p> <p>My other self acknowledgement is that I am a consumer. And a pretty intense one at that. I think I have spent a lot of time in my life mentally combatting the consumerist nature of 21st century life and its associated bollocks: Advertising, subscriptions, junk food, DLC packs for video games, social media, emojis etc. Some of it has actually turned out to pretty important within what I do (whether I like that fact or not), but also despite my aggressive anti-ness to it all I have my own behaviours that play right into it. Given a new TV show I will binge watch the crap out of it, regardless of what is going on. Third year of University was a terrible time to begin watching Game of Thrones. I can consume 160 gram bags of Haribo without realising it in under a minute. Costa coffee will go from a one off treat to a daily habit in under two weeks. Fast food will replace meals if allowed.</p> <p>I have consumed my media like this since childhood, since the first day Dad booted up Doom II for me at 5 years old. Since the first play through at 9 years old of the story telling master piece that is Metal Gear Solid. The hundreds of hours absorbing the soundtracks of WWE Smackdown and Tony Hawk’s Skateboarding. That was me growing up. I did not create things. I absorbed them. Video games were my medium and it was not until very late on (16/17 years old) that I truly began to recognise the individual components of what it was I was engaging with: the graphics. The design. The soundtracks. The bands. The story.</p> <p>When talking to Mum in the car 10 years ago: “I don’t know what I want to do. But I do know I don’t want it to be either in a service industry, or in sales.” Until then I had never processed the stuff I was playing in such a way that acknowledged that somebody out there made this stuff for money. That is me though, it still is. The anti-consumer consumer.</p> <h2 id="so-what-about-the-future">So what about the future?</h2> <p>For a while I have been considering the way I treat money. For the past 3 years I have been treating my money in the same way I treat my emails. Always working from zero base. Just as I would always attempt to get my email inbox to empty, so too would I attempt to empty my account each month. “To me,” I would say to my exasperated girlfriend, “It is all just digits. Numbers. I don’t care. As long as there’s enough going in to cover what’s going out, that’s fine by me. If it’s sitting there doing nothing then what’s the point in having it?”</p> <p>This approach is not working though. Funding the recent trip to Norway was hard. Even with a credit card. Without the full board of the cruise we would have starved. We took spending money with us however we were painfully aware of our bank accounts. On top of this, the chaos monkey approach to money management has meant that I have often put back things I want/ need to get done, simply because funds were unavailable at a given time. I have been meaning to get my driving licence for about 3 years now.</p> <p>We are always saving for the next big thing on the list, and always struggling to do it. Now it is Norway, previously it was our computers. Before that it was Berlin. Something has to change.</p> <p>So the plan is two fold. First, reduce all our outgoing costs to the absolute minimum. Lower our cost of living to a known number as low as possible. Today, I was looking into our Gas / Electricity costs. I cancelled Netflix. Tomorrow I am freezing our Gym memberships.</p> <p>Two, save a full 6 months of living costs in the bank. Realistically nothing will change in order to achieve this. Yesterday was my first Costa since booking the Norway trip 3 months ago. We have not eaten out in that time period either. If we maintain this for another 6-8 months we will have that capital saved up as breathing space for whatever we want in life.</p> <p>The other major concern is work. I’ve mentioned previously about being on review: with the cash buffer I’m hoping to dedicate some time to achieveing some accredidations: PHP, Docker, Networking etc. In doing so I am going to flesh out my knowledge in those areas and improve my value in the workplace. In the 6 months while I am saving I will have to find some other way improve my skills within the office — ideally I would like to get my head down and get on with it until I am ready to go and get the certs, but I do not think that is a viable option.</p> <p>In order to give myself some direction in the meantime, I am returning to what I know and love: Video Games. I think I am going to build a couple of projects alongside each other in order to play around with some code and the operations side of deploying / maintaining them. I am a huge fan of World of Warcraft. I think I will enjoy putting together some client/ server applications to mimic some of the behaviour they display. Potentially down the line there will be opportunity to develop some tools to help aid their development/configuration.</p> <p>I will begin by creating a client and a server that can connect to one another and send events back and forth. The client will likely just echo those events out to start. It will be interesting to see what tests get created to cover the respective applications’ functionality, interactions, and infrastructure.</p> <p>It will also give me something to write about on here, which is nice.</p> <p>Til next time, tussen takk.</p> <br> <nav class="pagination"> <a href="http://localhost:4000/burnout/" class="pagination_pager" title="Burnout ">previous</a> <a href="http://localhost:4000/can-you-hear-me-now/" class="pagination_pager" title="/var/log/can_you_hear_me_now ">next</a> </nav> </div> </div> <!-- JS --> <script src="http://localhost:4000/assets/js/main.min.js"></script> <div class="overlay"> <ul class="projects-menu"> <li style="background:url(http://taylantatli.me/Halve/images/halve-home-image.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Halve" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Halve Jekyll Theme <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/754514/14509720/61c61058-01d6-11e6-93ab-0918515ecd56.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Moon" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Moon Jekyll Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Ramme/master/assets/img/screenshot-post.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Ramme" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Ramme Jekyll Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Daisy-Pelican-Theme/master/Preview-1.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/Daisy-Pelican-Theme/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Daisy Pelican Theme </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/Block-Icon-Theme/master/Preview.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="https://github.com/TaylanTatli/Block-Icon-Theme" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Block Icon Theme <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> <li style="background:url(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TaylanTatli/StartPage/master/preview.png) center center no-repeat;"> <a href="http://taylantatli.me/StartPage/" class="inactive" target="_blank" rel="nofollow external"> <span> Start Page <br><em>in progress</em> </span> </a> </li> </ul> </div> </body> </html>
